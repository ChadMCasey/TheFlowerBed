ðŸŒ¼ The Flower Bed
A collaborative digital garden experience that teaches users about springtime flowers through interactive guides and accessible design.

ðŸ§¾ About This Project
The Flower Bed was built during a week-long hackathon with a team of four developers. Our goal was to create a calming and educational site where users could explore various flowers and learn how to care for them.

The project emphasizes collaboration, education, and UI/UX design. I contributed to layout design, tooltip interactions, and content structuring while working closely with my teammates using Git branching, issue tracking, and regular stand-ups.
