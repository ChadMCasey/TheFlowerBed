                  The genus was created by Carl Linnaeus in 1753 within volume one of his "Species Plantarum."
                  It is believed that the name originated from the Ancient Greek word ellÃ©boros. Many hellebore
                  species are considered toxic, and if ingested, have a burning acrid taste. This species can be planted
                  in the spring or fall, and does well in well drained, fertile soil.`,
